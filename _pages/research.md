Research Interests
======

* Computer vision, deep learning, and algorithms for large-scale remote sensing image and point cloud processing. Key focuses include 2D/3D vision (Graph Convolution, self-supervised learning, Transfer learning), geometric deep learning, 3D point cloud/mesh processing/NeRF. 
* Urban computing and environmental modeling. Key focuses include fusion of multi-source spatio-temporal geospatial data, assessment of urban infrastructure and 3D urban morphology, modeling of multi-scale human activities and sustainable interactions with the urban environment.
